Got to Learn about REACT.JS. 
Works in a more composed manner in terms of creating one component at a time using JavaScript and HTML.
It is quite easily to create a website with once understood properly.
The code in this Repository is just a tutorial of how I got to learn this from Bro Code in Youtube. Will be uploading a full sample website created with React.js. 
This has also helped in practicing more on Js and more involved.
